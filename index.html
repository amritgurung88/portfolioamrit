                Hello! I’m Amrit Gurung, a dedicated and passionate individual born in the serene and culturally rich district of Lamjung, Nepal. Growing up in such a naturally inspiring environment has shaped my creative mindset and motivated me to pursue excellence in everything I do. I believe in hard work, continuous learning, and using creativity as a tool for meaningful impact. My portfolio reflects a journey of growth, experience, and an unwavering commitment to quality. Each project I undertake is driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate, whether it's in design, development, or creative expression. I strive to combine technical skills with artistic vision to create work that is not only visually appealing but also purposeful. With every step forward, I aim to learn more, grow stronger, and contribute positively to the world around me. Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio—welcome to my story </p>
